<p>This has been a long and arduous process for me with several more steps ahead.</p>

<p>The genesis of the idea for this service was easy; it came suddenly and was intuitive.</p>

<p>Building the roadmap for launch took a little more time and effort but was undemanding.</p>

<p>The more difficult part lies in refining core strategy and messaging along with hitting the road (e.g. pavement, meetings, telephone, internet) and spreading it to potential champions.</p>

<p>One day, this blog will be used as the offical, online home of The Follow Through, but until then I will document my journey towards launch so you can follow along with me.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />Daniel Pollitt</p>
