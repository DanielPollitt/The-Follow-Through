**<center>The NFL: An Overview of the League and
Why the King of Sports Must Evolve to Survive</center>**

**<center>Background</center>**
The National Football League (NFL) is the most popular  and valuable sports association in the U.S. earning more than $9 billion per year in profit . However, the league faces a significant threat to its hegemony: the level and visibility of violence in professional football is increasing. Consequences of this violence, such as concussions and traumatic brain injuries, have risen in the public consciousness in recent years . More and more professional players and the media criticize the culture of the game with some current and former players going as far as saying they won’t let their children play football. The league must rapidly and holistically mitigate this problem or face a very uncertain future filled with medical liability suits, a shortage of players, and even complete financial ruin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this analysis we provide a fundamental look at the league’s violence problem, propose a simple but encompassing solution, and provide metrics to determine its efficacy.

**Acting on Violence Now**
>Junior played for 20 years. That's five concussions a game, easily. How many in his career then? That's over 1,500 concussions. I know that's startling, but I know it's true. I had over 1,000 in my 15 years. I felt the effects of it.

There are several additional factors—short and long term—that are slowly eroding the reputation of the league. The 2012 debacle of replacement referees  and completing a new collective bargaining agreement between players and owners at the end of this decade to avoid lockout  are issues that can cripple the effectiveness of less stable organizations. The NFL has been able to overcome these obstacles while retaining their organizational strength. However, the League’s issue of brain injuries as a result of decades of ingrained reckless violence is no longer being ignored.  Weekly fines of current players, widely circulated damaging statements from League stakeholders, and a powerful recent documentary on lingering mental injuries after retirement all attest to the new reality of a society that is now paying close attention to this most serious of issues. Therefore, the most imposing threat to the NFL comes not from concussions alone, but how the league and its stakeholders adjust to this new reality and work together to resolve this growing crisis.

**Successful Organizations Need to Continue to Evolve**  
Throughout history there are examples of companies and organizations that achieved economic dominance followed by rapid financial decline.From the great growth of 20th century businesses we examine the failures of these successful corporations to draw support for the need to change the culture of the NFL.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Tower Records before the MP3 , Swiss watchmakers before the “Quartz Crisis” , and American automobile makers in the later half of the 20th century , American football has it good, perhaps too good. The NFL’s annual revenue tops all U.S. sports , has the highest average per game attendance of spectator sports in the world , and claims some of the highest-rated television market shares ever . Just like the companies listed above the NFL stands at the apex of the American sports industry. The main reason these companies failed was to due to the fact they did not seek change until it was too late. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower Records could not find a way to profit off of digital music, digital watchmakers out-innovated dogmatic Swiss watchmakers, and the American automobile industry was so confident in its global advantage that they did not realize the looming danger from cheaper, more reliable imports. Just like these companies the NFL needs to examine if it is blinded by their current success.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples of business juggernauts failing to maintain their edge while they face internal and external pressures for change provide comparable lessons for the NFL. The league has a chance to remain the king of sports by getting out of its own way and charting a transparent course of unparalleled innovation regarding player safety--starting now.

**Culture Change**

**<center>Solutions</center>**
As consultants for change, we believe presenting multiple solutions for success is necessary. For our purposes, changing the culture of football from careless aggressive action to regulated violence is the goal. We have proposed two solutions for doing so.

**Solution #1**  
“Top-Down, Bottom-Up Approach”. There are two main tactics at work here. First, imposing harsher penalties and fines at the professional, college, and youth levels needs immediate implementation. We deem this the “Top-Down” approach. Second, we recommend combining this with a “Bottom-Up” approach focusing on concussion education and changing the culture from reckless violence to good, clean, hard football. 

**Part 1 “Top-Down”.**  We propose immediate codified change, specifically: binding mandates from the NFL Players Association & owners/commissioners office, the NCAA, and school boards/local communities. These include harsher penalties, higher fines, potential equipment changes, a player-youth safety education campaign, and economic incentives to attract more independent neurologists to each team and on the sideline of each game (to ensure impartial medical evaluation of players). 

**Part 2 “Bottom-Up”.** This is transformative, systemic change of the existing culture through education. The priority is public outreach to find and utilize change champions (famous current and former football players) to talk to youth about the symptoms, effects, and proper treatment of concussions. Outlining the importance of good sportsmanship is an important piece of this process as well.

**Solution #2**  
The second solution involves heavy policing of football at all levels. This would be implemented through the U.S. Congress passing laws mandating regulations in these specific areas: tightening medical rules, zero tolerance reckless violence policy, extremely harsh fines and suspensions, and creating an executive committee to oversee and revise the process of implementing new rules and regulations at the youth level.

**Preferred Solution for Change.** Solution #2 has its merits—mainly forced regulation of violence to improve the NFL’s culture—but for an organization with various stakeholders that hold diverging opinions on this subject, an inclusive and holistic approach is preferred. Therefore we recommend Solution #1, the “Top-Down, Bottom-Up” approach to transforming the culture of American football from one plagued by violent hits that cause brain injuries to a safer game that maintains its hallmarks of toughness and innovation.

**Intended Future State of American Football at all Levels**  
Our recommended change must be carefully implemented with framing the issue and its solution the key component to success. The end result of this change is football that contains the essence of what currently makes the game popular: innovation, excitement, and tough physical play. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public campaign for change we must take care not to be perceived as “diluting the game” or reducing it to a “soft”, “weak”, or “powder-puff” game. Should this occur, what will be needed is highly visible, forceful pushback on such charges from current and former football players that are recognized as “tough”, “physical”, and “macho”. In short, we need athletes whose qualities in these departments cannot be questioned.

**An Introspective and Democratic Approach**   
Given the scope, complexity, and scale of this change we recommend an inclusive approach consisting of all important stakeholders in the game of football. This includes but is not limited to: players, coaches, owners, referees, neurologists, and respected members of the sports media. There is already a significant amount of engagement (both discussion and debate) happening in youth and professional football that can be built upon . Through this method we need to identify what is currently working best and build on this knowledge to develop and design what will be achieved in the future. This process emphasizes the creation of conditions for co-construction of an ideal new state and a more democratic process of engagement .
 
**Measuring Positive Change**    
To determine the success of this campaign, there needs to be tangible, specific measurements of results. Here are our recommendations for metrics:

* Rate of Reduction in Injuries
  * Concussion / Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
  * Other (excludes all TBIs)
* Change in Players’ Awareness of Safety (through statistically run random questionnaires and tests)
  * Professional Football Players
  * Amateur Players
  * College
  * High school
  * Youth level
* Public Outreach (measured in dollars expended against this effort)
  * NFL (the corporate entity)
  * NFL Teams

**<center>The Road Ahead</center>**  
The National Football League is a highly political environment and for more than 90 years it has made money selling a violent, “gladiator” game . The alteration of deeply entrenched interests will take time and creativity. There are no illusions about an easy victory; the reality is only hard work and a consistent and sustained campaign to change the game will ensure its survival for future generations.
