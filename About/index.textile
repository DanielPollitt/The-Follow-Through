title: About Us
---
The Follow Through is a nonprofit dedicated to...wait, this is not the executive summary.</br> 
<br>Cue the real talk...</br>
<br>When it comes to the mind, athletes are just like the rest of us; they feel a range of emotions What usually sets them apart from other persons is fame, intense pressure, physical injuries, and most important--a general macho culture that makes vulnerability a weakness. We are changing that.</br>

<br>This project would not be up and running without the help of a few important peers:</br>
<br>
>Dr. John Whitman, professor, American University,</br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your guidance and giving me the 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tools to realize this benefit.</br>
><br>Tisha Allen, friend and marketing genius,
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the name and support!</br>

<br>Sincerely,</br>
Daniel
