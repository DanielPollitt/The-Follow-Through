	<h4>About Us</h4>
	When it comes to the mind, athletes are just like the rest of us; they feel a range of emotions What usually sets them apart from other persons is fame, intense pressure, physical injuries, and most important--a general macho culture that makes vulnerability a weakness. We are changing that.
	This project would not be up and running without the help of a few important peers:
	<br>
	<br>
	Dr. John Whitman, professor, American University: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				For your guidance and giving me the tools to realize this benefit.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Tisha Allen:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Friend and marketing genius, for the name and support!
			</li>
		</ul>
